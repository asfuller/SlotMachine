# Slot Machine Project: A text-based game 🎰💰
This is a Python-based game that resembles a slot machine, where you spin the reel to win or lose your bets.
Winning bets get added to your total bet, and losing bets get deducted from your total bet.

## How It Works
1. A user deposits a certain amount of money and can bet between one and three lines of a reel.
2. It's then determined, based on their bet, if a user won any lines
3. Then, it multiplies their bet by the value of the line and adds this value to their balance
4. Lastly, it allows users to keep playing until either they cash out or run out of money. 💸💵

### Try your luck and happy playing!! 😃
