# Slot Machine Project: A text-based game ðŸŽ°ðŸ’°
This is a Python-based game that resembles a slot machine, where you spin the reel to win or lose your bets.
Winning bets get added to your total bet, and losing bets get deducted from your total bet.

<i><b>Note:</b> This project is based on this [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/th4OBktqK1I?si=sbnVTriJ1o67_gTR). I give credit where it's due.</i>

## How It Works
1. A user deposits a certain amount of money and can bet between one and three lines of a reel.
2. It's then determined, based on their bet, if a user won any lines
3. Then, it multiplies their bet by the value of the line and adds this value to their balance
4. Lastly, it allows users to keep playing until either they cash out or run out of money. ðŸ’¸ðŸ’µ

## Closing Remarks
This project has helped me understand what I learned so far in Python a lot more and has inspired me to keep learning.
I hope that you enjoy playing the game like I did and earn some winnings!
